# geo-coffee

This project is to show off the various things that you can do in React Native.

This includes:
- Navigation
- Styling
- Authentication 
- Local Storage
- Realtime updates
- Use with Firebase
- Using geolocation and Google's APIs
- Videos within React Native

## Stuff to do: 

- Fix map screen to refresh dynamically when moving screen. Seems like there's a bit of an issue when updating state continually.
- Allow users to add favourites.
- Bring more details and styling to the Details Screen
- Styling 
- Make the application more modularised, right now there's not much modularity currently.
